              Understanding Blood Cupping (Hijama): What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Blood cupping, or Hijama, is a traditional therapy that involves creating a vacuum on the skin's surface using cups, followed by small incisions to draw out a small amount of blood. This technique is believed to help remove toxins, improve blood flow, and stimulate the body's natural healing processes. Hijama has been practiced for centuries in various cultures and is gaining popularity in modern holistic health practices for its numerous benefits.

              How Blood Cupping (Hijama) Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a blood cupping session, our skilled practitioner will place cups on specific areas of your body and create a vacuum to draw the skin and underlying tissues into the cup. After a few minutes, small incisions are made on the skin's surface, and the cups are reapplied to draw out a small amount of blood. The process is generally safe and minimally invasive, with many patients experiencing immediate relief and relaxation.

              Combining Blood Cupping with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine blood cupping with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the symptoms and underlying causes of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while blood cupping enhances detoxification and circulation. Together, these therapies work synergistically to promote healing and improve overall well-being.
