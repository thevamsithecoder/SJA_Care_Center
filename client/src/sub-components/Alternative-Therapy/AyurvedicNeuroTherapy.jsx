              Understanding Ayurvedic Neuro Therapy: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Ayurvedic Neuro Therapy combines the wisdom of Ayurveda, a 5,000-year-old system of natural healing from India, with the precision of chiropractic care. Ayurveda focuses on balancing the body's energies (doshas) to maintain health, while chiropractic care emphasizes the alignment of the spine and nervous system. Ayurvedic Neuro Therapy utilizes specific techniques to stimulate nerve function, enhance blood circulation, and promote the body's natural healing processes. This integrative approach aims to treat the root causes of health issues rather than just the symptoms.
