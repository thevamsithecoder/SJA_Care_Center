              Understanding Leech Therapy: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Leech therapy involves the use of medicinal leeches to improve health by drawing blood and injecting therapeutic substances into the body. Medicinal leeches secrete a complex mixture of bioactive compounds that include anticoagulants, vasodilators, and anti-inflammatory agents. These substances promote blood flow, reduce swelling, and support the body’s natural healing processes. Leech therapy is recognized for its effectiveness in treating a range of conditions, from chronic pain to circulatory disorders.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">

              How Leech Therapy Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a leech therapy session, our skilled practitioners will place medicinal leeches on specific areas of your body. The leeches attach themselves to the skin and begin to draw blood. As they feed, they release their therapeutic saliva into the bloodstream. The process typically lasts between 30 to 60 minutes, after which the leeches are removed and the treatment area is dressed. Most patients find the procedure to be relatively painless, with only a mild sensation as the leeches attach and begin to feed.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-5">
              Combining Leech Therapy with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine leech therapy with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the symptoms and underlying causes of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while leech therapy enhances circulation and reduces inflammation. Together, these therapies work synergistically to promote healing and improve overall well-being.
            </p>

              Aftercare and Continued Wellness
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              After your leech therapy session, our practitioners will provide you with aftercare instructions to maximize the benefits of the treatment. This may include guidelines for hydration, wound care, and recommendations for maintaining proper posture. We believe in empowering you with the knowledge and tools to support your long-term health and wellness.
