              Understanding Hot Cupping: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Hot cupping is a therapeutic practice that involves placing heated cups on the skin to create suction. This technique has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and other cultures to promote healing and enhance blood flow. The cups are typically made of glass, bamboo, or silicone and are heated before being applied to the skin. The heat creates a vacuum effect, drawing the skin and underlying tissues into the cup, which can help alleviate a variety of health issues.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Muscle Relaxation:</strong> The suction created by the cups helps release tension in the muscles, making it an effective treatment for tight or stiff muscles.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Detoxification:</strong> Cupping helps remove toxins from the body by improving lymphatic drainage.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> The relaxing nature of the treatment can help reduce stress and anxiety, promoting overall mental well-being.

              How Hot Cupping Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a hot cupping session, our skilled practitioner will apply heated cups to specific areas of your body. The cups are left in place for several minutes, allowing the heat and suction to penetrate deep into the muscles and tissues. You may feel a gentle pulling sensation, which is a sign that the treatment is working. The process is generally relaxing and can provide immediate relief from tension and discomfort.

              Combining Hot Cupping with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine hot cupping with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the symptoms and underlying causes of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while hot cupping enhances circulation and relieves muscle tension. Together, these therapies work synergistically to promote healing and improve overall well-being.
