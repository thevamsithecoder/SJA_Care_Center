              Understanding Acupuncture: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Acupuncture involves inserting thin, sterile needles into specific points on the body, known as acupoints. These acupoints are located along meridians, which are pathways that carry vital energy (Qi) throughout the body. The goal of acupuncture is to balance the flow of Qi, promoting healing and restoring health. This practice has been used for thousands of years and is recognized for its effectiveness in treating a variety of health conditions.

              Our Approach: Integrating Acupuncture into Chiropractic Care
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">

              How Acupuncture Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During an acupuncture session, our skilled practitioners will insert thin needles into specific acupoints on your body. The needles are typically left in place for 15 to 30 minutes. You may feel a mild tingling or slight pressure as the needles are inserted, but the procedure is generally painless and relaxing. Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system, releasing chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain that can alter the experience of pain and promote healing.

              Combining Acupuncture with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine acupuncture with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the symptoms and underlying causes of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while acupuncture enhances energy flow and alleviates pain. Together, these therapies work synergistically to promote healing and improve overall well-being.
