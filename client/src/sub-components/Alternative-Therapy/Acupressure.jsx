              Understanding Acupressure: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Acupressure involves applying pressure to specific points on the body, known as acupoints, to stimulate the body’s natural healing processes. These acupoints are located along meridians, which are pathways that carry vital energy (Qi) throughout the body. By targeting these points, acupressure can help balance energy flow, relieve pain, and improve overall health. Unlike acupuncture, which uses needles, acupressure relies on the gentle yet firm application of pressure using fingers, palms, elbows, or special devices.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">

              How Acupressure Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During an acupressure session, our skilled practitioners apply pressure to specific acupoints on your body. The pressure can be applied using fingers, thumbs, or special tools. The intensity and duration of the pressure are adjusted based on your comfort and the specific condition being treated. You may feel a gentle, relaxing sensation as the pressure is applied. Acupressure is generally a soothing and calming experience, and many patients report immediate relief from tension and discomfort.

              Combining Acupressure with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine acupressure with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the symptoms and underlying causes of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while acupressure enhances energy flow and alleviates pain. Together, these therapies work synergistically to promote healing and improve overall well-being.
