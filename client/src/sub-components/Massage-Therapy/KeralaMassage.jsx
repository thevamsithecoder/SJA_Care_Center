              Understanding Kerala Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Kerala Massage is deeply rooted in the ancient healing traditions of Ayurveda, which views the body as a holistic entity comprising physical, mental, and spiritual aspects. The word "Abhyanga" translates to "oil massage" in Sanskrit, reflecting the central role of warm herbal oils in this therapy. Kerala Massage involves the application of these oils to the entire body, followed by gentle, rhythmic massage strokes that help promote relaxation, balance the doshas (energies), and support overall well-being.
