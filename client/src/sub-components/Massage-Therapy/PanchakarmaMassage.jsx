              Understanding Panchakarma Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Panchakarma Massage is a comprehensive Ayurvedic therapy that aims to detoxify the body, balance the doshas (energies), and rejuvenate the entire being. The word "Panchakarma" means "five actions" in Sanskrit, referring to the five main cleansing and rejuvenating procedures involved in the treatment. These procedures include massage, herbal steam therapy, herbal enemas, nasal cleansing, and dietary adjustments. Panchakarma Massage is customized to each individual's unique constitution and health needs, making it a highly personalized and effective therapy.
