              Understanding Abhyanga Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Abhyanga Massage is a form of Ayurvedic massage therapy that has been practiced in India for thousands of years. The word "Abhyanga" translates to "oil massage" in Sanskrit, and the therapy involves the application of medicated herbal oils to the entire body. These oils are selected based on the individual's dosha (body constitution) and specific health concerns. The massage itself is performed using gentle, rhythmic strokes that help the oils penetrate deep into the tissues, promoting relaxation, detoxification, and rejuvenation.
