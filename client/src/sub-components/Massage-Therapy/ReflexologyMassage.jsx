              Understanding Reflexology Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Reflexology Massage is based on the principle that specific points on the feet, hands, and ears correspond to different organs, glands, and systems in the body. By applying pressure to these reflex points, Reflexology Massage stimulates the body's natural healing mechanisms, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation. This non-invasive therapy can help alleviate a wide range of health issues and promote overall balance and harmony within the body.

              How Reflexology Massage Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a Reflexology Massage session, our skilled practitioners apply pressure to specific reflex points on your feet, hands, or ears using their fingers, thumbs, and hands. The pressure is applied in a precise and systematic manner, targeting areas corresponding to specific organs, glands, and systems in the body.

Together, these therapies work synergistically to support your body's natural healing processes and promote optimal health.
