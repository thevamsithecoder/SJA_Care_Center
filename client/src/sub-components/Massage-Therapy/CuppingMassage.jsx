              Understanding Cupping Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Cupping Massage is an ancient therapeutic technique that involves placing special cups on the skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. This vacuum effect creates a negative pressure that gently lifts the skin and underlying tissues, promoting blood flow, lymphatic drainage, and relaxation of muscles and fascia. Cupping Massage can be performed using glass, silicone, or plastic cups, and it can be used on various parts of the body, including the back, shoulders, neck, and legs.

              Our Approach: Integrating Cupping Massage into Chiropractic Care
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we integrate Cupping Massage into our chiropractic treatments to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to your health and wellness.

              How Cupping Massage Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a Cupping Massage session, our skilled practitioners place suction cups on the skin and create a vacuum by suctioning out the air. The cups may be left in place for a few minutes or moved around the treated area to target specific muscles and tissues. The suction effect gently lifts the skin and underlying tissues, promoting blood flow, lymphatic drainage, and relaxation. The treatment may leave temporary marks on the skin, which typically disappear within a few days.

              Combining Cupping Massage with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine Cupping Massage with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the physical and energetic aspects of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while Cupping Massage promotes relaxation, reduces pain, and enhances overall well-being. Together, these therapies work synergistically to support your body's natural healing processes and promote optimal health.

              After your Cupping Massage session, our practitioners will provide you with aftercare instructions to help you maximize the benefits of the treatment.
