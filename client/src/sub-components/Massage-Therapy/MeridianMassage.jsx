              Understanding Meridian Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Meridian Massage is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which views the body as a network of meridians or energy pathways through which vital energy, or qi, flows. According to this ancient healing system, imbalances or blockages in the flow of qi can lead to physical, mental, and emotional health issues. Meridian Massage aims to restore balance and harmony by applying pressure to specific points along the meridian pathways, known as acupressure points, to promote the free flow of qi.

              How Meridian Massage Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a Meridian Massage session, our skilled practitioners apply gentle pressure to specific acupressure points along the meridian pathways using their fingers, thumbs, or palms. The pressure is applied in a precise and systematic manner to stimulate the flow of qi and promote balance and harmony within the body. The massage may also incorporate other techniques such as stretching, kneading, and tapping to further enhance relaxation and promote healing.

              Combining Meridian Massage with Chiropractic Adjustments
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For optimal results, we often combine Meridian Massage with chiropractic adjustments. This integrated approach helps address both the physical and energetic aspects of your health issues. Chiropractic adjustments restore proper alignment and function to the spine, while Meridian Massage promotes relaxation, balances energy flow, and enhances overall well-being. Together, these therapies work synergistically to support your body's natural healing processes and promote optimal health.
