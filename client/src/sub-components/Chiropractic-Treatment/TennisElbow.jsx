              Understanding Tennis Elbow: What Causes It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a common overuse injury that affects the tendons on the outside of the elbow. Despite its name, tennis elbow can occur in anyone who engages in repetitive arm movements, such as typing, painting, gardening, or playing musical instruments. The repetitive stress and strain on the tendons can lead to micro-tears and inflammation, resulting in pain, tenderness, and reduced range of motion in the elbow and forearm.

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Tennis Elbow
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Chiropractic care focuses on improving musculoskeletal function and joint health, promoting the body's natural ability to heal. Here's how SJA Care Services can benefit you:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques like massage can help decrease inflammation around the affected tendons, promoting healing and pain relief.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Blood Flow:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments may improve blood flow to the injured area, promoting faster healing and a more efficient delivery of nutrients to your tendons.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Nerve Function:</strong> Misalignments in the spine or elbow joint can sometimes irritate nerves that contribute to pain perception. Chiropractic care can potentially improve nerve function and reduce pain signals.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Strengthening Support System:</strong> Our chiropractor can design a personalized therapeutic exercise program to strengthen the forearm muscles that support your elbow joint, reducing stress on the tendons and promoting healing.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Biomechanics:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments can help improve your overall posture and biomechanics, potentially reducing repetitive strain on the elbow joint.
