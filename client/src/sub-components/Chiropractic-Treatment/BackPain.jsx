              Understanding Back Pain
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Your back is a complex structure made up of bones (vertebrae), muscles, ligaments, and nerves. Any one of these components can be the source of your back pain. Common causes include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Muscle strains:</strong> Overuse or improper lifting can lead to strained muscles in your back.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Sprains:</strong> Ligaments that connect your vertebrae can stretch or tear, causing pain and inflammation.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Disc problems:</strong> Herniated or bulging discs in your spine can press on nerves, resulting in pain, numbness, or weakness.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Arthritis:</strong> Degenerative changes in the joints of your spine can cause stiffness, pain, and inflammation.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Poor posture:</strong> Slouching or hunching can put undue stress on your back muscles and joints.
              </li>
