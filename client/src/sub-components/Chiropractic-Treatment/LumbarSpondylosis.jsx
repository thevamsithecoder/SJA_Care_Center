              Understanding Lumbar Spondylosis: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Lumbar spondylosis, also known as spinal osteoarthritis or degenerative disc disease, is a common condition characterized by the degeneration of the spinal discs and facet joints in the lower back (lumbar spine). As the discs lose their elasticity and height, and the facet joints become worn down, it can lead to pain, stiffness, and reduced flexibility in the lumbar region. Factors such as aging, repetitive stress, poor posture, and sedentary lifestyle can contribute to the development and progression of lumbar spondylosis.

              Causes of Lumbar Spondylosis
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              While age is the primary risk factor for lumbar spondylosis, other factors can contribute to its development:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people are simply more predisposed to developing degenerative joint conditions.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Occupation:</strong> Jobs that involve heavy lifting, bending, or twisting can put extra stress on the lower back.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight increases the strain on your spine, accelerating degeneration.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Poor posture:</strong> Sitting for extended periods with slouching or improper form can contribute to spondylosis.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Previous injuries:</strong> Injuries to the spine can increase the risk of developing spondylosis later in life.
