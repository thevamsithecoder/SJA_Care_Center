              Understanding Sciatica
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Sciatica isn't a disease itself, but rather a symptom of an underlying issue that irritates the sciatic nerve. This nerve, the longest in your body, runs from your lower back through your buttocks and down each leg. When something pinches or irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness along its path. Common causes of sciatica include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Herniated Disc:</strong> A bulging or ruptured disc in your spine can press on the sciatic nerve.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Spinal Stenosis:</strong> Narrowing of the spinal canal can put pressure on the nerve roots, including the sciatic nerve.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Muscle Strain or Inflammation:</strong> Tight or inflamed muscles in your buttocks can compress the sciatic nerve.
              </li>
            </ul>

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Sciatica
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we take a holistic approach to sciatica treatment. We begin with a thorough assessment to understand your medical history, the nature of your symptoms, and the underlying causes of your condition. This allows us to develop a personalized treatment plan tailored specifically to your needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              One of the primary techniques we use to treat sciatica is chiropractic adjustment. Through gentle spinal manipulations, our chiropractors can help realign the vertebrae, reduce pressure on the sciatic nerve, and improve overall spinal function. This not only alleviates pain but also enhances mobility and promotes natural healing.
