              Understanding Lordosis: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Lordosis refers to an excessive inward curvature of the spine, most commonly observed in the lower back (lumbar spine) or neck (cervical spine). While some degree of lordotic curvature is normal and necessary for spinal flexibility and shock absorption, an exaggerated curve can lead to pain, stiffness, and postural abnormalities. Common causes of lordosis include poor posture, muscle imbalances, obesity, spinal injuries, or congenital conditions.

              Causes of Excessive Lordosis
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Several factors can contribute to an excessive lordosis:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Weak core muscles:</strong> Weak abdominal and core muscles can't adequately support the spine, leading to an increased inward curve.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Tight hip flexors:</strong> Tight hip flexors, the muscles in the front of your hips, can pull your pelvis forward, contributing to lordosis.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improper posture:</strong> Sitting for extended periods with poor posture, such as slouching, can strain the lower back and worsen lordosis.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Previous injuries:</strong> Injuries to the spine or pelvis can lead to postural changes and an increased lordosis.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Our Approach: Addressing the Underlying Cause
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we take a comprehensive approach to chiropractic treatment for lordosis. Rather than merely focusing on symptom management, our experienced chiropractors strive to identify and address the underlying factors contributing to your condition. We begin by conducting a thorough assessment to evaluate the extent of your lordotic curvature, assess spinal alignment, and identify any muscular imbalances or structural issues.

              Hands-On Adjustments: Restoring Spinal Alignment
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Central to our chiropractic treatment for lordosis are hands-on spinal adjustments aimed at restoring proper alignment and function to the spine. Through gentle manipulation techniques, our chiropractors help realign misaligned vertebrae, alleviate pressure on the spinal discs and nerves, and promote optimal spinal curvature. These adjustments not only provide immediate relief from pain and discomfort but also facilitate long-term spinal health and stability.

              In addition to spinal adjustments, we incorporate muscle rehabilitation exercises to strengthen and stabilize the muscles supporting your spine.
