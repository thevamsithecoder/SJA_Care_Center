              Understanding Herniated Discs: What You Need to Know
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              A herniated disc, also known as a slipped or ruptured disc, occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc protrudes through the tough outer layer, pressing on nearby nerves and causing pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area. This condition commonly affects the lower back (lumbar spine) or neck (cervical spine) and can result from age-related degeneration, injury, or excessive strain on the spine.

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Herniated Discs
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Chiropractic care focuses on the body's natural ability to heal itself. Chiropractors are trained to identify and address misalignments in the spine and joints, which may be contributing to your disc issue. Here's how chiropractic care at SJA Care Services can benefit you:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Spinal Alignment:</strong> Gentle adjustments can help restore proper alignment in your spine, potentially taking pressure off the herniated disc and reducing nerve irritation.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques may help decrease inflammation around the irritated nerves, promoting healing and pain relief.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Nerve Function:</strong> By addressing misalignments that may be pinching nerves, chiropractic care can help improve nerve function and potentially alleviate pain, numbness, and weakness.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Pain Management:</strong> By addressing the underlying cause of the pain, chiropractic care can help manage discomfort associated with a herniated disc.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Faster Healing:</strong> Chiropractic care may promote a faster return to normal activities by encouraging blood flow and the body's natural healing processes.
              </li>

              Common Causes of Herniated Discs
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Several factors can contribute to a herniated disc, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Age-related wear and tear:</strong> As we age, the discs in our spine naturally become less flexible and more prone to tears.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improper lifting techniques:</strong> Lifting heavy objects with poor form can put excessive strain on your spine and discs.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Sudden movements:</strong> Twisting or bending awkwardly can increase the risk of a disc herniation.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight puts extra stress on your spine, including the discs.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Repetitive motions:</strong> Certain jobs or activities that involve repeated bending, twisting, or lifting can increase the risk of disc problems.
              </li>
