              Understanding Ankylosing Spondylitis
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Ankylosing Spondylitis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the spine. It causes inflammation in the joints between the vertebrae, leading to pain and stiffness. In some cases, the inflammation can cause new bone formation, which can eventually fuse the vertebrae together, limiting your flexibility. While there's no cure for AS, there are effective ways to manage it and maintain a healthy level of activity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we believe in taking a holistic approach to AS management. Our chiropractors are trained in techniques that focus on improving spinal mobility, relieving pain, and enhancing overall function. Through gentle adjustments and targeted therapies, we aim to alleviate discomfort, improve joint flexibility, and promote better posture.
