              Understanding Vertigo: What Causes It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Vertigo is a common vestibular disorder characterized by a false sensation of movement, often described as spinning, swaying, or tilting. It can result from various factors, including inner ear problems, vestibular migraines, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis, or trauma to the head or neck. Vertigo episodes may be triggered or exacerbated by changes in head position, sudden movements, or certain visual stimuli.

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Vertigo
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              While chiropractic care isn't a cure for all types of vertigo, it can be a valuable tool in managing BPPV and potentially cervicogenic vertigo. Here's how SJA Care Services can help:
            </p>

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Repositioning Maneuvers (BPPV):</strong> Our chiropractor is trained in specific repositioning maneuvers, like the Epley maneuver. These gentle head movements aim to help dislodge the misplaced crystals within your inner ear, potentially resolving BPPV symptoms within a few sessions.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Neck Mobility (Cervicogenic Vertigo):</strong> Gentle chiropractic adjustments to your neck can help restore proper alignment and reduce irritation of nerves that contribute to balance.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Muscle Tension:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques can help alleviate muscle tension in the neck, potentially reducing symptoms associated with cervicogenic vertigo.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Nerve Function:</strong> Misalignments in the spine can sometimes compress nerves, including those that influence balance. Chiropractic care can potentially improve nerve function and reduce vertigo triggers.

              Our Approach: Targeted Care for Your Vertigo
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we take a personalized approach to chiropractic treatment for vertigo. Our experienced chiropractors begin by conducting a thorough assessment to understand the underlying cause of your vertigo, evaluate your vestibular function, and identify any contributing factors such as spinal misalignments or muscle tension. We then develop a tailored treatment plan to address your specific needs and goals, focusing on relieving symptoms and restoring balance.

              Spinal Adjustments: Restoring Alignment and Function
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Central to our chiropractic treatment for vertigo are spinal adjustments aimed at restoring proper alignment and function to the spine. Through gentle manipulation techniques, our chiropractors realign misaligned vertebrae, alleviate tension in the neck and upper back, and improve communication between the brain and vestibular system. By restoring proper spinal alignment, we can alleviate pressure on the nerves and promote optimal function of the vestibular system, reducing the frequency and severity of vertigo episodes.

              Canalith Repositioning Maneuvers: Resolving BPPV
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              For patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), we may perform canalith repositioning maneuvers to help reposition displaced calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) within the inner ear. These maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver or the Semont maneuver, aim to move the crystals out of the semicircular canals, where they can cause dizziness and vertigo, and into a less sensitive area of the inner ear. By repositioning the crystals, we can alleviate symptoms and restore balance.

              Vestibular Rehabilitation: Improving Balance and Coordination
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              In addition to spinal adjustments and canalith repositioning maneuvers, we may incorporate vestibular rehabilitation exercises to improve balance, coordination, and proprioception. These exercises, which may include gaze stabilization exercises, balance training, and gait exercises, help strengthen the vestibular system, enhance sensory integration, and promote adaptation to changes in head position and movement. By improving vestibular function and enhancing compensatory mechanisms, we can reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo episodes and improve your overall quality of life.
