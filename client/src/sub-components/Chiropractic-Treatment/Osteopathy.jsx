                <strong>Chiropractic Care:</strong> Focuses primarily on the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine. Gentle adjustments aim to restore proper alignment and improve joint function, potentially reducing pain and improving nervous system communication.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Osteopathy:</strong> Takes a more holistic approach, considering the musculoskeletal, circulatory, nervous, and lymphatic systems. Osteopathic treatments involve manual therapy techniques, stretching, and sometimes even cranial osteopathy (gentle manipulations of the head) to address imbalances throughout the body.

              Understanding Osteopathy: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Osteopathy is a holistic approach to healthcare that focuses on the interrelationship between the body's structure and function, emphasizing the body's ability to heal itself. Osteopathic treatments aim to restore balance and harmony within the body by addressing musculoskeletal issues, improving circulation, and promoting overall well-being. By incorporating hands-on techniques, gentle manipulations, and lifestyle modifications, osteopathy seeks to optimize the body's natural healing mechanisms and enhance health from within.
