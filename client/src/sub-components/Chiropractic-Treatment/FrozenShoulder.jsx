              Understanding Frozen Shoulder
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is characterized by stiffness, pain, and reduced range of motion in the shoulder joint. This condition often develops slowly and can significantly impact your daily activities, making it difficult to lift your arm, reach for objects, or even dress yourself. It commonly affects people between the ages of 40 and 60, and while the exact cause is often unclear, it can be associated with prolonged immobility, shoulder injuries, diabetes, or other health conditions. Frozen shoulder typically progresses through three stages:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Freezing:</strong> This is the initial stage, characterized by increasing pain and a gradual loss of movement.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Frozen:</strong> This stage can last several months and involves significant stiffness and limited movement in your shoulder.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Thawing:</strong> During this stage, the pain gradually improves, and your range of motion slowly returns.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Causes of Frozen Shoulder
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              While the exact cause of frozen shoulder isn't always clear, some factors can increase your risk:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Age:</strong> Frozen shoulder is more common in people over 40.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Diabetes:</strong> People with diabetes are more likely to develop frozen shoulder.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Injury or surgery:</strong> Trauma to the shoulder or previous surgery can increase your risk.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Immobilization:</strong> Keeping your shoulder immobilized for an extended period can contribute to frozen shoulder.
              </li>

              </li>

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Faster Healing:</strong> Chiropractic care may promote a faster return to normal activities by encouraging blood flow and the body's natural healing processes.
