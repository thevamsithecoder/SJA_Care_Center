              Understanding Heel Pain
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Heel pain is a common complaint that can have various causes, including plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, Achilles tendonitis, and stress fractures. Regardless of the underlying cause of your heel pain, our experienced chiropractors are trained to identify the root of the problem and provide targeted treatment to alleviate your symptoms.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Heel pain can have a variety of causes, but some of the most common include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Plantar fasciitis:</strong> This inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue in the sole of your foot, can cause stabbing pain in the heel, especially in the mornings.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Heel spurs:</strong> These bony growths on the heel bone can irritate surrounding tissues, leading to pain.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Achilles tendonitis:</strong> Inflammation of the Achilles tendon, which connects your calf muscle to your heel bone, can cause pain at the back of your heel.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Arthritis:</strong> Degenerative changes in the joints of your foot can also contribute to heel pain.
              </li>

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Heel Pain
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              While chiropractic care isn't a cure for all types of heel pain, it can be a valuable tool in your overall management plan. Here's how SJA Care Services can benefit you:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Biomechanics:</strong> Gentle adjustments to your spine, ankles, and knees can help improve your overall alignment and posture, potentially reducing stress on your feet and addressing imbalances that contribute to heel pain.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques can help decrease inflammation in the tissues surrounding your heel, promoting healing and pain relief.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Mobility:</strong> Improved range of motion in your ankles and feet can provide better shock absorption and reduce strain on your heel.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Faster Healing:</strong> Chiropractic care may promote a faster return to normal activities by encouraging blood flow and the body's natural healing processes.
              </li>
            </ul>
