              Understanding Headaches
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Headaches can have various causes, including tension, stress, poor posture, spinal misalignment, muscle tension, or even underlying health conditions. Whatever the cause, our experienced chiropractors are trained to identify the root of your headaches and provide targeted treatment to alleviate your symptoms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              There are many different types of headaches, each with its own cause and symptoms. Some common types include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Tension headaches:</strong> These are the most common type, often caused by stress, muscle tension in the neck and shoulders, or poor posture.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Migraines:</strong> These severe headaches can cause throbbing pain, often on one side of the head, along with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Cervicogenic headaches:</strong> These headaches originate from the neck, often due to misalignments in the spine.
              </li>

              What to Expect at SJA Care Services
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Chiropractic care focuses on the body's natural ability to heal itself. Chiropractors are trained to identify and address misalignments in the spine and joints, which may be contributing to your headaches. Here's how SJA Care Services can help:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Spinal Alignment:</strong> Gentle adjustments can help restore proper alignment in your spine, which may reduce tension headaches and cervicogenic headaches by addressing potential underlying causes.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Muscle Tension:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques can help relax tight muscles in the neck and shoulders, potentially reducing tension headaches.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Nerve Function:</strong> By addressing misalignments that may be pinching nerves, chiropractic care can help improve nerve function and potentially reduce headaches.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Stress Management:</strong> Chiropractic care can be a valuable tool in your stress management toolbox. By promoting relaxation and improving overall well-being, it may help reduce stress-induced headaches.
              </li>
            </ul>
