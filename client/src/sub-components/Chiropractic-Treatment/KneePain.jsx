              Understanding Knee Pain: What Causes It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Knee pain can stem from various factors, including injuries, overuse, arthritis, or structural issues within the knee joint. Common conditions that may cause knee pain include osteoarthritis, tendonitis, ligament injuries, or patellofemoral pain syndrome. Identifying the underlying cause is crucial for developing an effective treatment plan that addresses the root of the problem and provides lasting relief.
