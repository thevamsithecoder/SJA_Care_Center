              Understanding Cervical Spondylosis: What Causes It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Cervical spondylosis is a condition that arises from the wear and tear of the cervical spine, which is the neck region of the spine. As we age, the discs and joints in our neck can degenerate, leading to the development of bone spurs and degenerative disc disease. Factors such as aging, repetitive strain, poor posture, and previous neck injuries can contribute to the progression of cervical spondylosis. Symptoms may include neck pain, stiffness, headaches, and, in severe cases, radiating pain or numbness in the arms and hands.
