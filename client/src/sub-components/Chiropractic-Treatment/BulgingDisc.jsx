              Bulging Discs with Chiropractic Care
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Your spine is made up of vertebrae stacked on top of each other. Between these vertebrae are discs that act like cushions, absorbing shock and allowing for movement. A bulging disc occurs when the inner gel-like substance of the disc pushes through a tear in the tough outer shell. This can put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves exiting the spine, causing various symptoms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Our approach to treating disc bulging begins with a comprehensive assessment. We take the time to understand your medical history, the nature of your symptoms, and the specific factors contributing to your condition. This thorough evaluation allows us to create a personalized treatment plan tailored to your unique needs and goals.

              Common Causes of Bulging Discs
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Several factors can contribute to a bulging disc, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Age-related wear and tear:</strong> As we age, the discs in our spine naturally become less flexible and more prone to tears.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improper lifting techniques:</strong> Lifting heavy objects with poor form can put excessive strain on your spine and discs.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Sudden movements:</strong> Twisting or bending awkwardly can increase the risk of a disc herniation (more severe than bulging).
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight puts extra stress on your spine, including the discs.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Repetitive motions:</strong> Certain jobs or activities that involve repeated bending, twisting, or lifting can increase the risk of disc problems.
              </li>
