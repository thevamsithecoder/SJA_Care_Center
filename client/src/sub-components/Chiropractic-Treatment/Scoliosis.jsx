            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Scoliosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, which can lead to pain, discomfort, and functional limitations. It can affect people of all ages, but early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to managing the condition effectively. Whether you or your loved one is dealing with a mild or severe case of scoliosis, our skilled chiropractors are equipped to provide the support and care you need.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we begin with a comprehensive assessment to understand the specifics of your scoliosis. This includes a detailed medical history, a physical examination, and, if necessary, imaging studies to get a clear picture of the spinal curvature. This thorough evaluation allows us to tailor a treatment plan that addresses your unique needs and goals.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Pain:</strong> By addressing misalignments in the spine and joints, chiropractic adjustments may help alleviate pain and discomfort associated with scoliosis.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Mobility:</strong> Improved range of motion in your spine can lead to better flexibility and potentially reduce limitations caused by scoliosis.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Complementary Therapy:</strong> Chiropractic care works well alongside other scoliosis treatment modalities, such as bracing and physical therapy, for a more comprehensive approach.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Proactive Management:</strong> Regular chiropractic care can help monitor your scoliosis and identify any potential changes early on.
