            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Arthritis is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing inflammation and stiffness in the joints. Whether you're dealing with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or another form of the disease, chiropractic care can offer valuable relief from your symptoms. The two most common types are:

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> This is the "wear and tear" type of arthritis, caused by the breakdown of cartilage, the cushioning material between your joints.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Rheumatoid Arthritis:</strong> This is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks the lining of your joints, causing inflammation and pain.

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help Manage Arthritis
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              At SJA Care Services, we take a holistic approach to arthritis treatment, addressing not only the symptoms but also the underlying factors contributing to your condition. Our chiropractors work closely with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that targets your specific needs and goals.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              One of the primary goals of chiropractic treatment for arthritis is to improve joint function and mobility. Through gentle spinal adjustments and manipulations, our chiropractors can help restore proper alignment to the spine and alleviate pressure on the affected joints. This can reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness, allowing you to move more freely and comfortably.

                <strong>Improved Joint Mobility:</strong> Gentle chiropractic adjustments can help restore some degree of movement in your affected joints, reducing stiffness and increasing your range of motion. This can make everyday activities like climbing stairs or reaching for objects much easier.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Studies suggest that chiropractic care may help lower inflammation in the body, which can be beneficial for those with rheumatoid arthritis.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Improved Function:</strong> Increased mobility and reduced pain can allow you to maintain a more active lifestyle, which can strengthen muscles and improve overall well-being.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Complementary Therapy:</strong> Chiropractic care works well alongside other arthritis treatment modalities, such as medication and physical therapy, for a more holistic approach to managing your condition.
