              Understanding Nerve Pain: What Causes It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Nerve pain, also known as neuropathy, occurs when nerves become damaged or dysfunctional, leading to abnormal sensations and impaired nerve function. It can result from various factors, including compression, inflammation, trauma, injury, infections, diabetes, or degenerative conditions such as herniated discs or spinal stenosis. Nerve pain can manifest in different parts of the body, including the neck, back, arms, legs, or feet, and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as weakness, muscle spasms, or difficulty with coordination.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Chiropractic adjustments and soft tissue therapy techniques may help decrease inflammation around irritated nerves, promoting healing and pain relief.

              Spinal Adjustments: Alleviating Pressure and Restoring Function
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Central to our chiropractic treatment for nerve pain are spinal adjustments aimed at alleviating pressure on the nerves and restoring proper function to the nervous system. Through gentle manipulation techniques, our chiropractors realign misaligned vertebrae, alleviate tension in the spine, and improve communication between the brain and body. By restoring proper spinal alignment, we can reduce compression on the nerves, alleviate pain, and improve nerve function.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              In addition to spinal adjustments, we may perform peripheral joint adjustments to address nerve pain originating from the extremities, such as the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, or ankles. By restoring proper joint alignment and function, we can reduce inflammation, improve mobility, and alleviate nerve pain in the affected area. These adjustments are gentle and precise, tailored to your individual needs and comfort level.
