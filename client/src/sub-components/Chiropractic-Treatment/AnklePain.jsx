              Understanding Ankle Pain
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Your ankles are complex joints that bear a lot of weight. They're made up of bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles that all work together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components experience stress, strain, or misalignment, it can lead to ankle pain. Common causes include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-5">
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Sprains:</strong> These occur when ligaments stretch or tear beyond their normal range of motion.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Strains:</strong> These happen when muscles or tendons are overused or torn.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Arthritis:</strong> Degenerative changes in the joint can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Fractures:</strong> Broken bones in the ankle can be incredibly painful and require immediate medical attention.
              </li>

              How Chiropractic Care Can Help
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Our chiropractic treatment for ankle pain begins with a comprehensive assessment of your condition. We take the time to understand your medical history, assess your current symptoms, and perform a thorough examination to pinpoint the root cause of your discomfort. This personalized approach allows us to tailor a treatment plan specifically suited to your needs.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              One of the primary techniques we use to alleviate ankle pain is chiropractic adjustment. Through gentle manipulations, our chiropractors realign the joints and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissues. This not only reduces pain but also enhances joint function and promotes natural healing.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Enhanced Range of Motion:</strong> By improving joint function, chiropractic care can increase your ankle's range of motion, allowing you to move more freely.
